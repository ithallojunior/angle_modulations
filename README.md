# Angle modulations

Simulations for FM and PM modulations/demodulations written in Python 
with Jupyter notebook.

## Running

In order to run you must install jupyter notebook, scipy, numpy and matplotlib. That can be done through Anaconda (search for anaconda python in order not to get Nicki Minaj's song ;) ). By the way, it's python 2.7.

Then you can run it from a terminal in its folder by typing:

$ jupyter notebook angle_modulations.ipynb 

## Running without jupyter

If you don't want to use jupyter for whatever reason, install 
the libraries (scipy, numpy and matplotlib) and run the python code 
in the folder by typing:

$ python angle_modulations.py
